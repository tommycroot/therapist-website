I'm a Person-Centred Therapist offering counselling in Abingdon-on-Thames and online. <br></br><br></br>

My background includes working with young adults, people navigating trauma, and those exploring or living with neurodiversity â€” as well as clients dealing with anxiety, stress, low mood, relationships, identity, and self-esteem. I don&apos;t assume what you need; I meet you where you are. 

I&apos;m grounded, open and direct in my style. My role isn&apos;t to judge, fix, or tell you who to be. It&apos;s to walk alongside you, help you feel heard and understood, and support you in making sense of your experiences in your own way. <br></br><br></br>
If you&apos;re unsure what you need but know something isn&apos;t right, we can explore it together.<br></br><br></br>
