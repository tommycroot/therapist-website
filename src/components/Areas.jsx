<h2>My Approach</h2>
<p className='area-1'>As a Person-Centred therapist, I offer a space where you can be yourself without pressure or judgement.<br></br>That means: </p>
<ul className="list">
<li>You set the pace</li> 

<li>We focus on what matters to you </li> 

<li>I listen actively and honestly </li>

<li>I’m alongside you, not above you </li> 

</ul>
<p className='area-2'>Clients often tell me they appreciate my realness. I’m not distant or clinical — I’m present, grounded and human in the room.<br></br><br></br>Whether you're dealing with something specific or you're not sure what's going on, we can explore it together safely and at your pace. </p>
